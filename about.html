      <p>
        Eco-friendly living means making choices that help protect the environment.
        It includes reducing waste, using sustainable products, saving energy, and 
        being conscious of our impact on the planet. By living sustainably, we 
        ensure a better future for the next generations.

        Small actions like recycling, using reusable bags, conserving water, and 
        choosing eco-friendly transport can make a big difference. Let's live 
        greener, cleaner, and smarter!
